# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Using-SMOTE-Logistic-Reg.
In the Project, Exploratory Data Analysis of Telecom Customer Data is done After EDA , I have shown how SMOTE which generates Synthetically minority class samples helps in improving Recall
The Project involves a Unbalanced Dataset ( 75:25). Though Accuracy is an important paramter but in this case when Its more important to predict Customer Churn ( Positive class) , What is more important is to consider Recall Metric
which is also called Sensitivity ( TP/(TP + FN)).

In the notebook it shas been shown How generating synthetic samples of Minor class helps in reducing the probelm of imbalanced dataset. 
Through SMOTE The recall of Positive Class has been improved by 11%
